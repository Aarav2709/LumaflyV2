<p align="center">
  Needlelight is a refreshed, production-ready evolution of the original Needlelight installer. It focuses on first-class support for Hollow Knight: Silksong, improved     stability when installing mods, and a cleaner, more maintainable codebase with better localization support.

Key improvements in Needlelight:

- Reworked game profile system: automatic detection and per-game executable resolution (better Silksong support).
- Safer installer flow with improved error handling around file access and mod installation.
- Small UX improvements: clearer messages, improved settings persistence, and fewer edge-case crashes.

## üéÆ Usage

- Download the latest version from the releases page.
- Default game = Hollow Knight. To manage Silksong, open Settings ‚Üí Game ‚Üí select "Silksong". The active profile changes immediately and persists to your config.
- Search through and download the mods you like.
- Mods appear in the top left corner of the game title screen after installation.
- Enable/Disable mods using the toggle. (Manual update UI was removed in v6.0.0.0 ‚Äî use the Releases page.)
- If you are unable to connect to the internet, LumaSong can be launched in offline mode where you can toggle mods/API.

## ‚ú® Features

- Multi‚Äëgame profiles: Switch between Hollow Knight and Hollow Knight: Silksong in Settings.
- Automatically downloads the [Modding API](https://github.com/hk-modding/api) which is required for mods to load. It also allows switching between modded and vanilla via the Toggle API button.
- Search through the 300+ mods available in the [official modlinks](https://github.com/hk-modding/modlinks).
- Group mods in modpacks and share them using the commands.
- Display mods that were recently updated or released.
- A single place to install, update, configure, view readmes, and report issues for mods.
- Manage mods not available through modlinks via the manual install button.

## üîÑ Migration notes

- Older configs continue to load with Hollow Knight as the default (`game` missing or set to `hollow_knight`).
- When you choose Silksong in Settings, the config persists `silksong` and will restore that on next launch.

## ü™ü Windows SmartScreen (free workaround)

Because the app isn‚Äôt code-signed with a paid certificate, Windows SmartScreen may warn on first launch. Free options:

- Unblock the downloaded ZIP before extracting.

  - Right‚Äëclick the ZIP ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí check ‚ÄúUnblock‚Äù ‚Üí OK ‚Üí then extract.
  - Or in PowerShell (replace the filename if different):

    ```powershell
    Unblock-File -Path .\Needlelight-Windows.zip
    Expand-Archive .\Needlelight-Windows.zip -DestinationPath .\Needlelight
    ```

- If already extracted, unblock the files:

  ```powershell
  Get-ChildItem .\Needlelight -Recurse | Unblock-File
  ```

- Verify downloads with the provided SHA256SUMS.txt in each release.

Note: Fully removing SmartScreen requires a trusted code‚Äësigning certificate (paid). The steps above avoid the ‚Äúdownloaded from the internet‚Äù flag and keep things safe and free.

## üîê Verify downloads (SHA‚Äë256)

Each release includes a `SHA256SUMS.txt` file. Verify the file(s) you downloaded match the published checksums.

- Download `SHA256SUMS.txt` from the same release as your file.
- Put it in the same folder as the file(s) you want to verify.

Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
# Show the file's SHA-256 and compare with SHA256SUMS.txt
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 .\Needlelight-Windows.zip

# Optionally verify multiple files manually by comparing the printed hash
# with the corresponding line in SHA256SUMS.txt.
```

Windows (Command Prompt)

```bat
certutil -hashfile Needlelight-Windows.zip SHA256
```

macOS

```bash
# Quick: print a file's hash
shasum -a 256 Needlelight-MacOS.zip

# Check against the whole list (expects files next to SHA256SUMS.txt)
shasum -a 256 --check SHA256SUMS.txt
# Outputs: "filename: OK" or "FAILED"
```

Linux

```bash
# Quick: print a file's hash
sha256sum Needlelight-Linux.zip

# Check against the whole list (expects files next to SHA256SUMS.txt)
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt
# Outputs: "filename: OK" or "FAILED"
```

Tip: You can also verify individual executables (e.g., `Needlelight.exe`, `Needlelight.AU.exe`) using the same commands.
