LumaflyV2 is a refreshed, production-ready evolution of the original Lumafly installer. It focuses on first-class support for Hollow Knight: Silksong, improved stability when installing mods, and a cleaner, more maintainable codebase with better localization support.

Key improvements in LumaflyV2:

- Reworked game profile system: automatic detection and per-game executable resolution (better Silksong support).
- Safer installer flow with improved error handling around file access and mod installation.
- Better internationalization and updated translations.
- Small UX improvements: clearer messages, improved settings persistence, and fewer edge-case crashes.

## üéÆ Usage

- Download the latest version from the releases page.
- Default game = Hollow Knight. To manage Silksong, open Settings ‚Üí Game ‚Üí select "Silksong". The active profile changes immediately and persists to your config.
- Search through and download the mods you like.
- Mods appear in the top left corner of the game title screen after installation.
- Enable/Disable mods using the toggle and update outdated mods using the orange update button.
- If you are unable to connect to the internet, LumaSong can be launched in offline mode where you can toggle mods/API.

## ‚ú® Features

- Multi‚Äëgame profiles: Switch between Hollow Knight and Hollow Knight: Silksong in Settings.
- Automatically downloads the [Modding API](https://github.com/hk-modding/api) which is required for mods to load. It also allows switching between modded and vanilla via the Toggle API button.
- Search through the 300+ mods available in the [official modlinks](https://github.com/hk-modding/modlinks).
- Group mods in modpacks and share them using the commands.
- Display mods that were recently updated or released.
- A single place to install, update, configure, view readmes, and report issues for mods.
- Manage mods not available through modlinks via the manual install button.

## üîÑ Migration notes

- Older configs continue to load with Hollow Knight as the default (`game` missing or set to `hollow_knight`).
- When you choose Silksong in Settings, the config persists `silksong` and will restore that on next launch.
